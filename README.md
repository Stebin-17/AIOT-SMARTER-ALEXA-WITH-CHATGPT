# AIOT-SMARTER-ALEXA-WITH-CHATGPT

## INTRODUCTION:

Imagine a world where you don't need to lift a finger to control the ambiance of your home. With the help of cutting-edge technology, this dream is now a reality. Introducing "Smarter Alexa with ChatGPT for Controlling LED Lights," a project that revolutionizes the way we interact with our smart homes. This project combines the power of Amazon's Alexa and ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art language model, to create a seamless and intuitive experience for controlling LED lights. By using natural language processing, this project allows users to simply speak their commands to Alexa, who then communicates with ChatGPT to accurately interpret and execute the desired actions.
To implement this project, a Raspberry Pi 4 is used as a server to communicate with the Alexa Skill Set. The Raspberry Pi 4 is a powerful microcomputer capable of running multiple programs simultaneously, making it an ideal choice for handling the complex communication between Alexa and ChatGPT. Additionally, the project utilizes the Wiznet-EVB-PICO-5100s board, which is connected to both the LED lights and an 8*8 dot matrix. This board acts as a bridge between the Raspberry Pi and the LED lights, allowing for easy control and manipulation of the light's color and intensity. With the Wiznet-EVB-PICO-5100s board, the LED lights can be synced to music, set to change color depending on the time of day, or even programmed to display scrolling messages on the dot matrix.
